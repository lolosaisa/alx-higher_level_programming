This directory consists of practices of Python Error Handling and Exceptions

An exception is an abnormal event or error that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. 
Exceptions are typically caused by errors in the program, external factors (such as input from a user or data from a file), or unexpected conditions.

In Python, exceptions are represented as objects, and the language provides a mechanism for handling them through the use of the try, except, else, and finally statements.
